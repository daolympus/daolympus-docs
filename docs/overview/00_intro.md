# What is DAOlympus?

The DAOlympus protocol is a decentralized financial (DeFi) system that supports DAOHM, a treasury backed, liquidity-enabling token on the Base network. DAOlympus leverages the mechanisms of Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL), DAO-Token Bonding, and active Liquidity Management to create a robust, flexible, censorship-resistant, and smart unit of exchange.

The goal of DAOlympus is to build a programmatic policy-controlled money that:
* Maintains reliable liquidity across decentralized exchanges.
* Is used as a unit of account within the daosdotworld ecosystem (e.g., by being paired against DAO tokens)
* Is utilized as a trusted asset (e.g., to collateralize other assets or deposited into protocols’ treasuries).
* Is fully decentralized and controlled by the community
* Is financially flexible, allowing users to borrow the backing against their money

## Why do we need DAOlympus in the first place?

Fiat-pegged stablecoins have become an essential part of crypto due to their lack of volatility as compared to tokens such as Bitcoin and Ether. Users are comfortable with transacting stablecoins knowing they hold the same amount of purchasing power today vs. tomorrow. Unfortunately, this is a fallacy. Fiat dollars are controlled by centralized government monetary policy and always decrease in purchasing power (inflation). This depreciation of the dollar also means a depreciation of these stablecoins. DAOlympus provides an alternative to Web3’s reliance on centralized, censorable stablecoin assets, for the daosdotworld ecosystem.
