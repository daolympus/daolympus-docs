# Treasury

The Treasury is a key component of the DAOlympus protocol. The Treasury represents all assets owned and controlled by the protocol.

The primary responsibility of the Treasury is to ensure DAOHM liquidity on open markets and stabilize DAOHM with direct market operations in certain situations. 

The treasury is comprised of DAO token reserves and DAOHM liquidity positions, which are held in the on-chain treasury contract. DAOlympus employs a streamlined treasury management strategy. Treasury assets may be staked through governance as opportunities for DAO token staking appear.
