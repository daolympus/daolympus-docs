# DAOHM

## DAOHM token
> **OHM Contract Address:**  DEPLOYMENT PENDING

DAOHM is the native token of the DAOlympus protocol, and is fully-backed by the DAOlympus Treasury. DAOHM is not pegged to any fiat currency. Instead, it is a free-floating "flatcoin" that programmatically and transparently targets a backing value based on a desired treasury makeup. DAOHM aims to fill the gap between fiat stablecoins and volatile crypto assets, providing relative stability and scalability in the daosdotworld ecosystem in a fully autonomous way with no off-chain dependencies.
