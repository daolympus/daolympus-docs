# Protocol Owned Liquidity

## Overview

OlympusDAO pioneered the concept of Protocol Owned Liquidity (POL), ensuring liquidity for OHM holders without relying on liquidity mining incentives. DAOlympus looks to push POL even further as a mechanism for treasury management. POL manifests itself as dex based liquidity. In the future, RBS swaps and Cooler loans may be used to increase DAOHM liquidity. This will ensure users and protocols are always able to swap DAOHM, regardless of market conditions and external events.
